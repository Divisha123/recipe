STEP 1
@ Place chicken pieces in a large stock pot.
@ When you've cut as much chicken meat as you'd like, simply add it to a large pot and you're done.
@ If you'd prefer, you can also remove the skin, though this isn't essential.
STEP 2
@ Add water to cover, salt, and bay leaf. 
@ Add enough water to cover all of your chicken, but don't feel the need to over-do it .
@ If your soup is too thick, you can always add more water later, while waiting for a watery soup to reduce is time-consuming.
@ For added flavor, you may optionally add the chicken bouillon at this point as well.
STEP 3
@ Cover the pot and bring to boil. 
@ Over medium-high heat, this should take about 8-10 minutes, but may take more or less time depending on how much water you use.
STEP 4
@ Uncover and skim off the top froth.
@ When your water starts boiling, remove the lid and remove the froth at the top with a wooden spoon. 
@ This prevents the water from boiling over.
STEP 5
@ Allow to simmer about 2 1/4 hours. 
@ Your goal is to make the chicken meat so soft that it falls off the bone. 
@ As your soup simmers, periodically check on it to ensure that the chicken is cooking nicely and to skim any froth off the top of the pot.
STEP 6
 @ Add the onions, celery, and carrots and a pinch or two of parsley. 
 @ After your chicken has cooked for a few hours, you may add your vegetables, which take less time to cook.
 STEP 7
 @ Allow to simmer about 45 minutes. Stir periodically to ensure even mixing and to eliminate top froth.
 STEP 8
 @ Allow to simmer about 45 minutes. 
 @ Stir periodically to ensure even mixing and to eliminate top froth.
 STEP 9
 @ Optionally, place cooked noodles or rice in bowl and add soup.
 @ To recreate a bowl of classic childhood chicken noodle soup, simply add cooked noodles (or rice) to your soup. Pasta and rice take less time to cook than your soup takes to make,
 so you can prepare them while your soup is simmering with ample time to spare.
