<h1> Procedure for making vanilla pound cake </h1>
<p> 
Gather your ingredients. Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake. Here's what you'll need:
STEP 1
@ 1 cup (225 g) of unsalted butter, softened
@ 1 cup (225 g) of granulated sugar
@ A pinch of salt
@ 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of vanilla extract
@ 5 eggs, room temperature
@ 2 cups (240 g) of cake flour (or, you can use 2 cups minus 2 Tbsp (234 g) of all-purpose flour plus 2 Tbsp (16 g) of cornstarch)
STEP 2
@ Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C) and grease and flour a cake pan. 
@ Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.
@ Use butter or shortening to grease the pan.
@ Then, sprinkle a light layer of flour into the pan, rotate the pan until it’s evenly coated, then tap out the excess flour.
STEP 3
 @ Cream the butter and sugar.
 @ Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl 
 @ Beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.
STEP 4
  @ Add the eggs and vanilla. For best results, add the eggs one at a time and beat the mixture in between.
  @ Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.
STEP 5
 @ Stir in the cake flour. 
 @ Keep the electric mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated.
 @ Be careful not to overmix it.
 STEP 6
 @ Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
 STEP 7
@ Bake the cake for 1 hour 15 minutes.
@ Rotate the pan 180 degrees halfway through the cook time to ensure it bakes evenly. 
@ The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
@ Enjoy your delicious homemade cake! :) :) :)
